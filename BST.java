public class BST {
    // Introduction to  Trees:"
    // A tree is a hierarichal data structure consisting of nodes,
    // with a root node at the top and child nodes below it.

    // Trees are widely used iin application sucg as databases etc:

    //Types of Trees:
    // Binary Tree: Each node has at most two childrens(left and right)
    // Binary search Tree:
    // A binary tree where:
    // left child<parent
    // right child>Parent

    // Balanced Tree: AVL trees,Red black treesetc
    // Heap:
    // Trie:etc:

    // Given an binary tree,return the level order traversal  of its nodes value.


    // Approach:FIFO():We have to use Quueue for BFS traversal":
    // process nodes level by level:
