    // Recursion and BackTracking are the powerful techniques used to solve the complex problems. on matrices
    // and grids.
    // These techq allows us to explore all the possible solutions by making choices,
    // moving forward  and backtracking when the solution is not valid..

    // Problem Statement: You have given a grid m*n of characters and a string word,
    // we have to retuyrn true if the word exists in the grid.
    // The word can be constructed from letters in adjcenet cells(Hori or VErt).
    // The same letter cell cannot be used more than once.


    // Approach:

    // use DFS(Depth First search ) with backtracking.

    // Start from each cell, try to match the first letter of the word.

    // Explore in all the possible directions.


    // If the characters of the word matches,return true.
    // if the path is incorrect,backtrack and mark all the cells   as unvistsed.
